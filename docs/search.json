    "title": "Using A Neural Network with Pytorch To Classify Lego Minifigures",
    "section": "",
    "text": "CLICK HERE TO OPEN THE JUPYTER NOTEBOOK\nIn the linked notebook, I implemented a deep NN using Tensorflow to classify mini-figures from the Marvel World, Harry Potter, Star Wars and Jurassic World. Implementation of the Neural Network together with the results can be found in the link above. Below is a short primer on deep neural networks and a list of references used to write the\n\nA Primer on Deep Neural Networks\nA Neural Network (NN) is a deep learning algorithm inspired by the structure of neurons in the human brain. Like the neurons in the human brain signal to each other to allow us to perform any activity, in a NN neurons, so-called nodes, signal to each other to allow the network to perform a task. In this example the task consists in classifying Lego characters from a set of pictures.\nA NN is usually comprised of an input layer, one or more hidden layers and an output layer. The picture below shows an example of a simple NN with two hidden layers:\n\n\n\nExample of a Neural Network with Two Hidden Layers\n\n\nIn each layer, nodes receive the signal from one or more of the nodes in the previous layers, perform different a series of calculations, and send the output of these calculations to nodes in the subsequent layers. The calculation performed within each node involves estimating a set of weights which will help us understanding how much of the signal needs to be pushed from one node to the next one. Weights are essential. At each iteration the NN learns by adjusting these weights!\n\nHow does a neural network learns?\nIn other words, how can a NN classify each Lego mini-figure?\n\nStep 1: Forward Pass. Impute the data, initialize the weights, and push the signal from the input layer to the output layer through the hidden layers.\nStep 2: The Cost Function. Once the forward pass is over, the NN outputs its prediction for each image. In this step we need to choose a metric (i.e., a cost function) and evaluate how close/far we are from the truth. For instance, in the Lego classification problem we should ask ourselves the question: how many pictures were correctly classifies by the NN? The aim of the NN is to minimise this user-defined metric.\nStep 3: Backpropagation. After computing the error in step 2, the NN moves backwards from the output to the input layer going through the hidden layers. This is the step where the NN is actually learning something! The main idea is to combine the chain rule (yes, the chain rule when learned we studying derivatives) with an optimisation algorithm such as gradient descent to change the weights for each neuron in order to minimise the metric from Step 2.\nStep 4: Keep Going. Repeat step 1 to 3 until the weights in each neuron do not change anymore (or change really really little).\n\n\n\nWhy has the world used NN in the last 15 years only?\nThe number of parameters we need to estimate is HUGE!! Each node has its own set of weights, so the more layers a network has, the higher is the number of weights we need to estimate. This created a computational problem: while the theory of NN has been around for the long time, the computational capabilities needed to train a NN are recent.\n\n\n\nReference\n[1] IBM Webpage\n[2] When were Lego first manufactured?\n[3] Data augmentation in Tensorflow\n[4] A more in-depth discussion on DenseNet121"

    "title": "An Exploration of Extreme Weather Events in the US",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The Data\nIn this blog post we are going to look at severe weather events recorded in the US between 2016 and 2021. The data used in this blog post were downloaded on December 21, 2022 from Kaggle. First, let’s have a quick look at the data. There are approximately 7.5 million of events recorded (7,479,165 to be exact) by 1,973 weather stations across the US and 14 variables. A look into the paper of Moosavi et al linked at the end of this page allows us to understand what each variable represents. Here are the variables we will be looking at:\n\nType. This is a factor with 7 levels: severe-cold (temperatures \\(\\leq\\) 23.7C), fog, hail, rain, snow, storm (this involves rain and winds), and precipitation (anything else that is not classified as rain or snow).\nSeverity. This is a factor indicating the severity of a weather event. For this analysis we are going to consider only the events classified as heavy or severe.\nStartTime(UTC). Date indicating when the event started\nTimeZone. This is a factor with 4 levels indicating the US time zones: Eastern, Central, Mountain and Pacific\nLocationLat. Latitude\nLocationLng. Longitude\nCity\nState\n\n\n\nNumbers and Trends of Severe Events Across the US\nFirst, we are going to look at weather trends in the last five years. Of the seven initial types of weather events, there were no severe precipitation and hail events; thus, from now on we will only be looking at cold, fog, rain, snow and storm. For ease of reading the y-axis in the plot we divide the total number of events by 1,000. Here are a couple of interesting things about the plot below:\n\nFog was the most common severe events in all of the last five years, followed by extreme cold and rain\nThere is a big increase of registered fog events between 2018 and 2019. In the same year, a big decrease in rain event was registered. Wondering if something changed in the classification of events?\n\n\n\nCode\n# load packages\nlibrary(data.table)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(viridis)\nlibrary(usdata)\nlibrary(ggpubr)\nlibrary(knitr)\n\n# import data\ndat <- fread(\"WeatherEvents_Jan2016-Dec2021.csv\")\n# only take severe events\ndat.severe <- dat[Severity %in% c(\"Severe\", \"Heavy\")]\n\n# create a variable start year\nsetDT(dat.severe)[, StartYear := format(as.Date(`StartTime(UTC)`), \"%Y\")]\n# create a variable indicating the number of severe events by year. Get the start year\nevents <- dat.severe[, .(NumEventYearType = .N/1000), by = c(\"StartYear\", \"Type\")]\nggplot(events, aes(x = StartYear, y = NumEventYearType, color = Type, group = 1)) +\n    geom_point() + geom_line() + facet_wrap(.~Type, scales = \"free\") +\n    labs(x = \"Year\", y = \"Number of Events (per 1,000)\", \n         title = \"Number of Severe and Heavy Weather Events Across the US\") +\n    theme_minimal() + theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n    scale_color_viridis(discrete = TRUE) \n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we are going to add an extra layer to the plot above by looking at weather trends by time zones in the last five years. The drop in the number of rain events we have seen in the plot above was registered in all the time zones but the US Pacific, while we can see that the number of fog events increased in all time zones between 2018 and 2019.\n\n\nCode\n# events per type and area\narea <- dat.severe[, .(NumEventAreaType = .N/1000), \n                   by = c(\"StartYear\", \"Type\", \"TimeZone\")]\nggplot(area, aes(x = StartYear, y = NumEventAreaType, color = Type, group = 1)) +\n     geom_point() + geom_line() + \n    facet_wrap(Type~TimeZone, scale = \"free\", ncol = 4) +\n    labs(x = \"Year\", y = \"Number of Events (per 1,000)\", \n         title = \"Number of Severe an Heavy Weather Events Across the US\") +\n    theme_minimal() + theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n    scale_color_viridis(discrete = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, let’s add a finer layer to our plots and map the number of severe events by State and time. In all the plots a dark purple States are those with a lower number of events, while yellow and green States are those with higher number of events.\nStarting with fog events it is clear that Texas is the State where most fog events are registered followed by California. Overall, there were not insanely crazy trends, but the number of fog events registered is quite constant across time in each State.\n\n\nCode\n# events by time, type and lat and longitudine\nevents.states <- dat.severe[, .(NumEventYearType = .N), \n                            by = c(\"State\", \"StartYear\", \"Type\")]\n# convert States abbreviation to complete names\nevents.states$region <- tolower(usdata::abbr2state(events.states$State))\n\n# map of US states (continguos US only)\nus        <- ggplot2::map_data(\"state\")\n# merge by state\nus        <- dplyr::inner_join(us, events.states, by = \"region\")\n\n# function to create the plots\nplot.weather <- function(year, type){\n ggplot(subset(us, StartYear == year & Type == type)) + \n          geom_polygon(aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, \n                           fill = NumEventYearType), color = \"black\") +\n          theme_minimal() + \n    theme(axis.ticks = element_blank(), axis.text = element_blank(), \n          legend.position = \"bottom\", legend.key.size = unit(1, 'cm'))+\n    labs(x = \"\", y = \"\", title = paste(\"Extreme\", type, \"Events Registred in the US in\", year)) +\n    scale_fill_viridis(name = \"Number of Events\")   \n}\n\nyears      <- 2016:2021\nevent.list <- unique(us$Type)\np.events   <- list()\nfor(i in seq_along(event.list)){\n    p          <- list()\n    for(j in seq_along(years)){\n        p[[j]] <- plot.weather(year = years[j], type = event.list[i])\n    }\n    p.events[[i]] <- ggarrange(p[[1]], p[[2]], p[[3]], \n                               p[[4]], p[[5]], p[[6]], ncol = 2, nrow = 3,\n                               common.legend = TRUE, legend=\"bottom\")\n}\n\n\n\n\nCode\np.events[[1]]\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, let us move to extreme rain. Again the number of rain events are similar within each state across time. It is interesting how little rain California gets compared to the amount of fog. Also, Florida is one of the States where the majority of rain events are recorded. A guess is that hurricane season might have had an impact of this number.\n\n\nCode\np.events[[2]]\n\n\n\n\n\nThus, let us look at extreme cold. As expected the States with extreme cold events tend to be those closer to the Canadian border (Michigan and Minnesota stood out from this map).\n\n\nCode\np.events[[3]]\n\n\n\n\n\nThen comes the snow. There are no extreme snow events recorded in Tennessee in 2017 and in Louisiana in 2018, and like for the extreme cold the northern States are those that record the higher number of events. It is striking, however, how much the number of snow events increase from 2016 to 2021.\n\n\nCode\np.events[[4]]\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the extreme storms. Here we go back to the trend we have seen for other weather events: the number of extreme storm event does not change within each state across time (with the exception of Texas where the number of extreme storm events increase between 2016 and 2021).\n\n\nCode\np.events[[5]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich Cities Got the “Worst” Weather?\nThe table below shows the top 10 cities in the US where the highest number of heavy and severe weather events are recorded. This is a top 10 where most of the people might not want to be part of!\nThere are three cities in Florida in the top 10 (again hurricane might be the big culprit here), but the city the the highest number of recorded severe weather events is Mullan, Idaho.\n\n\nCode\ncities <- dat.severe[, .(NumEventAreaType = .N), by = c(\"City\", \"State\")]\nsetorder(cities, cols = -\"NumEventAreaType\") \nkable(head(cities, 10), col.names = c(\"City\", \"State\", \"Number of Events\"))\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Top 10 cities recording\n\n\nCity\nState\nNumber of Events\n\n\n\n\nMullan\nID\n4971\n\n\nThompson Falls-West End\nMT\n4802\n\n\nSargents\nNH\n4775\n\n\nTampa\nFL\n4617\n\n\nJacksonville\nFL\n4588\n\n\nSouth Beach\nOR\n4394\n\n\nLompoc\nCA\n4292\n\n\nPanama City\nFL\n4056\n\n\nWolf Creek\nOR\n3960\n\n\nTillamook\nOR\n3671\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA short read on the climate Mullan, ID (thanks to Wikipedia) shows that Mullan tend to be really cold and snowy in the winter, nd a quick look at the data shows how 311 extreme snow events were recorded in five years (this is approximately 62 extreme events a year!)\n\n\nCode\nmullan <- dat.severe[City == \"Mullan\"]\nkable(mullan[, .(NumEventAreaType = .N), by = c(\"Type\")],\n      col.names = c(\"Type\", \"Number of Events\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nType\nNumber of Events\n\n\n\n\nFog\n4610\n\n\nCold\n36\n\n\nSnow\n311\n\n\nRain\n14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReference\n[1] Moosavi, Sobhan, Mohammad Hossein Samavatian, Arnab Nandi, Srinivasan Parthasarathy, and Rajiv Ramnath. “Short and Long-term Pattern Discovery Over Large-Scale Geo-Spatiotemporal Data.” In Proceedings of the 25th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining, ACM, 2019.\n[2] Wikipedia page on Mullan, ID."
