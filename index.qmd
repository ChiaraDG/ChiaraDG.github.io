## About Me

I am a Research Associate at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/school-public-health/) working in the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics. Currently, I am working on multiple projects raging from understanding the long-term health effects of radiation exposure, to studying the effect of long COVID.

I received a PhD in Biostatistics from [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vumc.org/biostatistics). My research interests include longitudinal data, epidemiological study design, and integration of multiple data sources to improve the precision of randomised trials. Before joining Vanderbilt, I worked as statistician for the "Nutrition, Development and Lifelong Health in Transitioning Populations" programme at the [MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit](https://www.mrc.soton.ac.uk/web2/).
